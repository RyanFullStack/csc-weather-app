Weather App for Chicagoland Skydiving Center

This is a work in progress when I have free time. It will eventually replace the current wind meter at wx.skydivecsc.com

UPDATE: This app has been deployed live by the business as app.skydivecsc.com

PLEASE CHECK THE WIKI FOR THE CURRENT UPDATE LOG

Thanks for looking!
