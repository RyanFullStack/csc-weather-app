This app has been deployed live by the business at app.skydivecsc.com and the business advertises this link to customers.

This app is currently being used live heavily by both employees and customers to make important safety decisions. I, the creator of this app, Ryan Erickson, am a 15+ year skydive veteran with over 2,000+ skydives, multiple instructional ratings, and am a current Safety and Training Advisor to the United States Parachute Association.

I am actively seeking to improve my skills and I am consistenetly learning new technologies and challenging myself. Please reach out for inquiries at the contact links on my profile.
